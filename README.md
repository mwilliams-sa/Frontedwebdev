Purpose of Visual Styling

The goal of the visual styling was to create a warm, inviting, and easy-to-read design that reflects the cozy and friendly personality of a small local bookstore. 


Colour Scheme

I used soft lavender (#E7DDFF) and purple tones (#E2ABF1, #a07be9, #6b4fad) throughout the site.

These colours create a calm, whimsical, and bookish vibe — ideal for a boutique-style bookshop.

The white backgrounds in sections like the book cards offer contrast and keep the content clean and readable.


Typography

I used the Arial, sans-serif font for readability and simplicity.


Layout

Consistent padding and margins help space out content for visual clarity and breathing room.


Overall Theme

The "Little Bookshop" is meant to feel welcoming, creative, and personal — like stepping into a small, independent bookstore. The gentle pastel colours and soft layout support this:

Colours feel light and warm, inviting readers to stay and explore.

Simple fonts and spacing ensure the site feels approachable, not overwhelming.


How I Validated the Stylesheet

I used the W3C CSS Validation Service to scan the stylesheet for any warnings or mistakes.


Reflection and Challenges

I kept the font and layout simple — I wanted the design to look neat.

Learning: Using flexbox and @media queries helped me make a layout that works across desktop and mobile, which I hadn’t done much before.
